# Nodejs-Express-Server

### Basic-Server

Simple Server Using Just nodejs

Now navigate to the folder in a terminal/console window and type: node index.js to execute your file. A message that reads “Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000” should be displayed and the server is now waiting for connections.

Open a browser and visit: http://localhost:3000; localhost and the ip address 127.0.0.1 point to the same thing: your local computer. The browser should show the message: “Hello World from Node”. There you have it, your first web server, built from scratch using nothing but Node.js.
